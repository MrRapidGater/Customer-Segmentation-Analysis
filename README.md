# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
The provided code demonstrates a customer segmentation analysis pipeline using K-means clustering. It begins by loading and preprocessing a dataset containing customer attributes. Visualizations are used to explore the distribution of features like family size, work experience, and profession. Missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical variables are scaled. The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering. Finally, the dataset is clustered into segments, and the distribution of clusters is visualized. This code serves as a comprehensive example for implementing customer segmentation techniques in Python using popular data science libraries like pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
